# Cursor AI SQL Practice

This repository documents my practice using Cursor and its built-in AI to explore SQL and small project development.

So far, I followed a beginner Cursor AI tutorial and experimented with building a basic note-taking app by asking the AI to generate code for me. While I didn’t end up using a SQL database in this first project, the experience helped me understand how Cursor can assist in building full-stack applications quickly.

To deepen my understanding of SQL specifically, I’ll be watching and following along with this tutorial:  
[Performing SQL Operations with Assistance from Cursor AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkY7GAMG5B8)

As I continue, I plan to:
- Build a small project that incorporates actual SQL database operations
- Use Cursor AI to generate and explain SQL queries
- Document what I learn step by step in this repo

This is an ongoing learning process and this repo will grow with more practice files, SQL scripts, and project experiments.
