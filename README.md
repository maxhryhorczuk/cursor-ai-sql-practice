Cursor AI SQL Practice

This repository documents my practice using Cursor and its built-in AI to explore SQL and small project development.

So far, I’ve built a note-taking application, where I initially worked through a beginner tutorial. Although I didn't end up using a SQL database for that first project, the experience gave me insight into how Cursor can help with full-stack development.

Next, I shifted focus to SQL, using Cursor AI to create a database for an ecommerce application. This helped me understand SQL operations better, especially how to build and manipulate databases effectively.

The work in this repo includes:

01: Creating a database for an ecommerce project using AI-generated SQL scripts. This process helped me deepen my understanding of SQL.

02 & 03: These views were created to organize and structure the data for product sales and order information. The views provided a simplified way to access and work with relevant data, allowing me to run more complex queries. These helped me better understand how relational data works in SQL, particularly how different tables (such as products, orders, and order items) are connected.

04: Writing SQL queries that leverage these views to analyze and explore specific data relationships (e.g., revenue per category, customer spending patterns, order details).

I’ve also generated queries based on AI to explore relationships between orders, products, and order items, further improving my understanding of SQL.

Ongoing Learning
This repo will continue to grow with more practice files, SQL scripts, and project experiments. I plan to:

Build more small projects that incorporate SQL database operations.

Use Cursor AI to generate and explain SQL queries.

Document my learning step by step.
