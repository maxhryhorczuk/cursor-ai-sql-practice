Learning Log

This section outlines key skills and tools Iâ€™ve learned while building this project with Cursor and PostgreSQL:

-Learned how to use GitHub Desktop to manage version control and push project files to GitHub.

-Connected my local PostgreSQL server to Cursor for real-time SQL query execution and testing.

-Gained experience in creating fake database information for testing, including creating tables, inserting data, and setting up relationships between tables.

-Learned how to create specific queries for eCommerce logistics, such as managing products, orders, and customer data, and how to explore those relationships using SQL.

Created queries to explore relationships within the database, including:

  -Pairing orders with products and order items

  -Exploring total revenue per category

  -Analyzing customer spending patterns

  -Creating category performance summaries with views like product_sales and order_summary

  -Summarizing data by order status and multi-item orders

  -Extracting top-selling products and their relationship to completed orders
  
You can also run these queries in pgAdmin4, giving you more flexibility on where and how you test the SQL code.
